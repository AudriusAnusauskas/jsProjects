MobilePay is a mobile payments solution which can be used to send money to your friends or buy goods from 
merchants. Even though MobilePay is one of the top choices as payment
service providers for merchants, it doesn't come for free. MobilePay has various rules to calculate the
fee that we should charge each merchant for using MobilePay. So far we are doing this manually by using
data from databases and lot's of excel spreadsheets and macros, then we use calculated fees to make an
invoice which we send to a merchant.  An application is needed to replace those manual error prone calculations.

 

Your task is to implement this piece of code that would be responsible for calculating fees for transactions.

 

Following business rules have been defined for first release of the application:

All merchants should be charged 1% of transaction amount
Telia merchant should get 10% discount
Circle_K merchant should get 20% discount
Transactions made during weekends are free of charge
When transaction number exceeds 10 for a merchant, he gets additional 20% discount for each next transaction
 

The tech lead has provided additional non-functional requirements for this application:

Ubiquitous language should be used in the solution ( https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/ubiquitous-language )
Code should be flexible enough to change, add or remove rules.
To add new rule you shouldn't need to change existing code (except for facade class). (SOLID principle)
Precise naming is important
App should accept transactions as input below: 
        2018-09-01 7-ELEVEN 50                                                                                    
        2018-09-04 CIRCLE_K 30                                                                                    

Fees should be formatted as output below:
        2018-09-01 7-ELEVEN 0.00
        2018-09-04 CIRCLE_K 0.80
 

Calculation examples

 

Transaction:

2018-09-04 CIRCLE_K 50 

Fee:

2018-09-04 CIRCLE_K    (50 * 0.01)

1% fee rule = 50 * 0.01 = 0.5

Circle_K discount 20% = 0.5 - (0.5 * 0.2) = 0.4

If this would be >10 transaction = 0.4 - (0.4 * 0.2) = 0.32
